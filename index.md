Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>
and 
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/epp/" target="_blank">Public Policy</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by 
<a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a>
and
<a href="https://ines.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">In&#234;s Azevedo</a>.
I am also co-founder and chair of <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">Climate Change AI</a>, an initiative to facilitate impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning.

My work lies at the intersection of machine learning, electric power systems, and climate change mitigation.
Specifically, I am interested in creating novel machine learning techniques that incorporate domain knowledge (such as power system physics) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector.
Please see the [here](/publications) for a list of my recent publications.

I am funded through the U.S. Department of Energy's 
<a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/" target="_blank">Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</a>
and was previously an NSF Graduate Research Fellow.
I received my undergraduate degree at Harvey Mudd College in computer science and math with an emphasis in environmental analysis.
